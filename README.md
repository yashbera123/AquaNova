AquaNova – Real-Time Groundwater Monitoring App

detecting and analyzing groundwater levels using DWLR data.
Problem statement:-

Groundwater is central to India’s drinking water, agriculture, and industry. Despite covering 3.3 million sq. km and housing 16% of the world’s population, India has only 4% of global freshwater resources. Overexploitation, uneven distribution, and climate variability make sustainable groundwater management critical.
